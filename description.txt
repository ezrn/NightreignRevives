Nightreign Revives adds a revive system inspired by Elden Ring Nightreign.

- When players die in boss fights or invasions, they instead go down, and leave a small flame
- Other players can deal damage to this flame to stoke it, reviving the downed player after dealing enough damage
- Automatically revives downed players if the boss is defeated, or if all players are downed
- Compatible with most mods, please report any incompatibilities you find!
